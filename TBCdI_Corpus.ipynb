used to convey information and meaning with semantic cues such as words, signs, or images.', 'It’s been said that language is easier to learn and comes more naturally in adolescence because it’s a repeatable, trained behavior—much like walking.', 'And language doesn’t follow a strict set of rules, with so many exceptions like “I before E except after C.” What comes naturally to humans, however, is exceedingly difficult for computers with the amount of unstructured data, lack of formal rules, and absence of real-world context or intent.', 'That’s why machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) are gaining attention and momentum, with greater human dependency on computing systems to communicate and perform tasks.', 'And as AI and augmented analytics get\\xa0more sophisticated, so will Natural Language Processing (NLP).', 'While the terms AI and NLP might conjure images of futuristic robots, there are already basic examples of NLP at work in our daily lives.', 'Here are a few prominent examples.', 'Email filters', 'Email filters are one of the most basic and initial applications of NLP online.', 'It started out with spam filters, uncovering certain words or phrases that signal a spam message.', 'But filtering has upgraded, just like early adaptations of NLP.', \"One of the more prevalent, newer applications of NLP is found in Gmail's email classification.\", 'The system recognizes if emails belong in one of three categories (primary, social, or promotions) based on their contents.', 'For all Gmail users, this keeps your inbox to a manageable size with important, relevant emails you wish to review and respond to quickly.', 'Smart assistants', 'Smart assistants like Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s', 'Alexa recognize patterns in speech thanks to voice recognition, then infer meaning and provide a useful response.', 'We’ve become used to the fact that we can say “Hey Siri,” ask a question, and she understands what we said and responds with relevant answers based on context.', 'And we’re getting used to seeing Siri or Alexa pop up throughout our home and daily life as we have conversations with them through items like the thermostat, light switches, car, and more.', 'We now expect assistants like Alexa and Siri to understand contextual clues as they improve our lives and make certain activities easier like ordering items, and even appreciate when they respond humorously or answer questions about themselves.', 'Our interactions will grow more personal as these assistants get to know more about us.', 'As a New York Times article “Why We May Soon Be Living in Alexa’s World,” explained: “Something bigger is afoot.', 'Alexa has the best shot of becoming the third great consumer computing platform of this decade.”', 'Search results', 'Search engines use NLP to surface relevant results based on similar search behaviors or user intent so the average person finds what they need without being a search-term wizard.', 'For example, Google not only predicts what popular searches may apply to your query as you start typing, but it looks at the whole picture and recognizes what you’re trying to say rather than the exact search words.', 'Someone could put a flight number in Google and get the flight status, type a ticker symbol and receive stock information, or a calculator might come up when inputting a math equation.', 'These are some variations you may see when completing a search as NLP in search associates the ambiguous query to a relative entity and provides useful results.', 'Predictive text', 'Things like autocorrect, autocomplete, and predictive text are so commonplace on our smartphones that we take them for granted.', 'Autocomplete and predictive text are similar to search engines in that they predict things to say based on what you type, finishing the word or suggesting a relevant one.', 'And autocorrect will sometimes even change words so that the overall message makes more sense.', 'They also learn from you.', 'Predictive text will customize itself to your personal language quirks the longer you use it.', 'This makes for fun experiments where individuals will share entire sentences made up entirely of predictive text on their phones.', 'The results are surprisingly personal and enlightening; they’ve even been highlighted by several media outlets.', 'Language translation', 'One of the tell-tale signs of cheating on your Spanish homework is that grammatically, it’s a mess.', 'Many languages don’t allow for straight translation and have different orders for sentence structure, which translation services used to overlook.', 'But, they’ve come a long way.', 'With NLP, online translators can translate languages more accurately and present grammatically-correct results.', 'This is infinitely helpful when trying to communicate with someone in another language.', 'Not only that, but when translating from another language to your own, tools now recognize the language based on inputted text and translate it.', 'Digital phone calls', 'We all hear “this call may be recorded for training purposes,” but rarely do we wonder what that entails.', 'Turns out, these recordings may be used for training purposes, if a customer is aggrieved, but most of the time, they go into the database for an NLP system to learn from and improve in the future.', 'Automated systems direct customer calls to a service representative or online chatbots, which respond to customer requests with helpful information.', 'This is a NLP practice that many companies, including large telecommunications providers have put to use.', 'NLP also enables computer-generated language close to the voice of a human.', 'Phone calls to schedule appointments like an oil change or haircut can be automated, as evidenced by this video showing Google Assistant making a hair appointment.', 'Data analysis', 'Natural language capabilities are being integrated into data analysis workflows as more BI vendors offer a natural language interface to data visualizations.', 'One example is smarter visual encodings, offering up the best visualization for the right task based on the semantics of the data.', 'This opens up more opportunities for people to explore their data using natural language statements or question fragments made up of several keywords that can be interpreted and assigned a meaning.', 'Applying language to investigate data not only enhances the level of accessibility, but lowers the barrier to analytics across organizations, beyond the expected community of analysts and software developers.', 'To learn more about how natural language can help you better visualize and explore your data, check out this webinar.', 'Text analytics', 'Text analytics converts unstructured text data into meaningful data for analysis using different linguistic, statistical, and machine learning techniques.', 'While sentiment analysis sounds daunting to brands--especially if they have a large customer base--a tool using NLP will typically scour customer interactions, such as social media comments or reviews, or even brand name mentions to see what’s being said.', 'Analysis of these interactions can help brands determine how well a marketing campaign is doing or monitor trending customer issues before they decide how to respond or enhance service for a better customer experience.', 'Additional ways that NLP helps with text analytics are keyword extraction and finding structure or patterns in unstructured text data.', 'There are vast applications of NLP in the digital world and this list will grow as businesses and industries embrace and see its value.', 'While a human touch is important for more intricate communications issues, NLP will improve our lives by managing and automating smaller tasks first and then complex ones with technology innovation.', 'Try Tableau for free to create beautiful visualizations with your data.\\n', 'Try Tableau for free', 'Try Tableau for free to create beautiful visualizations with your data.', 'Try Tableau for free', 'Predictive text', 'Things like autocorrect, autocomplete, and

language processing (NLP) is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI).', 'This is a widely used technology for personal assistants that are used in various business fields/areas.', 'This technology works on the speech provided by the user, breaks it down for proper understanding and processes accordingly.', 'This is a very recent and effective approach due to which it has a really high demand in today’s market.', 'Natural Language Processing is an upcoming field where already many transitions such as compatibility with smart devices, interactive talks with a human have been made possible.', 'Knowledge representation, logical reasoning, and constraint satisfaction were the emphasis of AI applications in NLP.', 'Here first it was applied to semantics and later to the grammar.', 'In the last decade, a significant change in NLP research has resulted in the widespread use of statistical approaches such as machine learning and data mining on a massive scale.', 'The need for automation is never ending courtesy of the amount of work required to be done these days.', 'NLP is a very favourable, but aspect when it comes to automated applications.', 'The applications of NLP have led it to be one of the most sought-after methods of implementing machine learning.', 'Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field that combines computer science, linguistics, and machine learning to study how computers and humans communicate in natural language.', 'The goal of NLP is for computers to be able to interpret and generate human language.', 'This not only improves the efficiency of work done by humans but also helps in interacting with the machine.', 'NLP bridges the gap of interaction between humans and electronic devices.', 'Working', 'The field is divided into \\xa0three different parts:', 'Speech Recognition\\u200a—\\u200aThe translation of spoken language into text.', 'Natural Language Understanding (NLU) \\u200a—\\u200aThe computer’s ability to understand what we say.', 'Natural Language Generation\\u200a (NLG) —\\u200aThe generation of natural language by a computer.', 'NLU and NLG are the key aspects depicting the working of NLP devices.', 'These 2 aspects are very different from each other and are achieved using different methods.', 'Speech Recognition:', 'First, the computer must take natural language and convert it into artificial language.', 'This is what speech recognition, or speech-to-text, does.', 'This is the first step of NLU.', 'Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are used in the majority of voice recognition systems nowadays.', 'These are statistical models that use mathematical calculations to determine what you said in order to convert your speech to text.', 'HMMs do this by listening to you talk, breaking it down into small units (typically 10-20 milliseconds), and comparing it to pre-recorded speech to figure out which phoneme you uttered in each unit (a phoneme is the smallest unit of speech).The program then examines the sequence of phonemes and uses statistical analysis to determine the most likely words and sentences you were speaking.', 'Natural Language Understanding (NLU):', 'The next and hardest step of NLP, is the understanding part.', 'First, the computer must comprehend the meaning of each word.', 'It tries to figure out whether the word is a noun or a verb, whether it’s in the past or present tense, and so on.', 'This is called Part-of-Speech tagging (POS).', 'A lexicon (a vocabulary) and a set of grammatical rules are also built into NLP systems.', 'The most difficult part of NLP is understanding.', 'The machine should be able to grasp what you said by the conclusion of the process.', 'There are several challenges in accomplishing this when considering problems such as words having several meanings (polysemy) or different words having similar meanings (synonymy), but developers encode rules into their NLU systems and train them to learn to apply the rules correctly.', 'Natural Language Generation (NLG):', 'NLG is much simpler to accomplish.', 'NLG converts a computer’s artificial language into text and can also convert that text into audible speech using text-to-speech technology.', 'First, the NLP system identifies what data should be converted to text.', 'If you asked the computer a question about the weather, it most likely did an online search to find your answer, and from there it decides that the temperature, wind, and humidity are the factors that should be read aloud to you.', 'Then, it organizes the structure of how it’s going to say it.', 'This is similar to NLU except backwards.', 'NLG system can construct full sentences using a lexicon and a set of grammar rules.', 'Finally, text-to-speech takes over.', 'The text-to-speech engine uses a prosody model to evaluate the text and identify breaks, duration, and pitch.', 'The engine then combines all the recorded phonemes into one cohesive string of speech using a speech database.', 'Technologies related to Natural Language Processing', 'Machine Translation: NLP is used for language translation from one language to another through a computer.', 'Chatterbots: NLP is used for chatter bots that communicate with other chat bots or humans through auditory or textual methods.', 'AI Software: NLP is used in question-answering software for knowledge representation, analytical reasoning as well as information retrieval.', 'Applications of Natural Language Processing (NLP):', 'Spam Filters: One of the most irritating things about email is spam.', 'Gmail uses natural language processing (NLP) to discern which emails are legitimate and which are spam.', 'These spam filters look at the text in all the emails you receive and try to figure out what it means to see if it’s spam or not.', 'Algorithmic Trading:', 'Algorithmic trading is used for predicting stock market conditions.', 'Using NLP, this technology examines news headlines about companies and stocks and attempts to comprehend their meaning in order to determine if you should buy, sell, or hold certain stocks.', 'Answering Questions: NLP can be seen in action by using Google Search or Siri Services.', 'A major use of NLP is to make search engines understand the meaning of what we are asking and generating natural language in return to give us the answers.', 'Summarizing Information: On the internet, there is a lot of information, and a lot of it comes in the form of long documents or articles.', 'NLP is used to decipher the meaning of the data and then provides shorter summaries of the data so that humans can comprehend it more quickly.', 'Future Scope:', 'Bots: Chatbots assist clients get to the point quickly by answering inquiries and referring them to relevant resources and products at any time of day or night.', 'To be effective, chatbots must be fast, smart and easy to use, To accomplish this, chatbots employ NLP to understand language, usually over text or voice-recognition interactions', 'Supporting Invisible UI: Almost every connection we have with machines involves human communication, both spoken and written.', 'Amazon’s Echo is only one illustration of the trend toward putting humans in closer contact with technology in the future.', 'The concept of an invisible or zero user interface will rely on direct communication between the user and the machine, whether by voice, text, or a combination of the two.', 'NLP helps to make this concept a real-world thing.', 'Smarter Search: NLP’s future also includes improved search, something we’ve been discussing at Expert System for a long time.', 'Smarter search allows a chatbot to understand a customer’s request can enable “search like you talk” functionality (much like you could query Siri) rather than focusing on keywords or topics.', 'Google recently announced that NLP capabilities have been added to Google Drive, allowing users to search for documents and content using natural language.', 'Future Enhancements:', 'Companies like Google are experimenting with Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to push the limits of NLP and make it possible for human-to-machine interactions to feel just like human-to-human interactions.', 'Basic words can be further subdivided into proper semantics and used in NLP algorithms.', 'The NLP algorithms can be used in various languages that are currently unavailable such as regional languages or languages is spoken in rural areas etc.', 'Translation of a sentence in one language to the same sentence in another Language at a broader scope.', 'Natural-language-processing',

', 'Finally, you’ll see for yourself just how easy it is to get started with code-free natural language processing tools.', 'What Is Natural Language Processing (NLP)?', 'How Does Natural Language Processing Work?', 'Challenges of Natural Language Processing', 'Natural Language Processing Examples', 'Natural Language Processing with Python', 'Natural Language Processing (NLP) Tutorial', 'What Is Natural Language Processing (NLP)?', 'Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that makes human language intelligible to machines.', 'NLP combines the power of linguistics and computer science to study the rules and structure of language, and create intelligent systems (run on machine learning and NLP algorithms) capable of understanding, analyzing, and extracting meaning from text and speech.', 'What Is NLP Used For?', 'NLP is used to understand the structure and meaning of human language by analyzing different aspects like syntax, semantics, pragmatics, and morphology.', 'Then, computer science transforms this linguistic knowledge into rule-based, machine learning algorithms that can solve specific problems and perform desired tasks.', 'Take Gmail, for example.', 'Emails are automatically categorized as Promotions, Social, Primary, or Spam, thanks to an NLP task called keyword extraction.', 'By “reading” words in subject lines and associating them with predetermined tags, machines automatically learn which category to assign emails.', 'NLP Benefits', 'There are many benefits of NLP, but here are just a few top-level benefits that will help your business become more competitive:', 'Perform large-scale analysis.', 'Natural Language Processing helps machines automatically understand and analyze huge amounts of unstructured text data, like social media comments, customer support tickets, online reviews, news reports, and more.', 'Automate processes in real-time.', 'Natural language processing tools can help machines learn to sort and route information with little to no human interaction – quickly, efficiently, accurately, and around the clock.', 'Tailor NLP tools to your industry.', 'Natural language processing algorithms can be tailored to your needs and criteria, like complex, industry-specific language – even sarcasm and misused words.', 'How Does Natural Language Processing Work?', 'Using text vectorization, NLP tools transform text into something a machine can understand, then machine learning algorithms are fed training data and expected outputs (tags) to train machines to make associations between a particular input and its corresponding output.\\n', 'Machines then use statistical analysis methods to build their own “knowledge bank” and discern which features best represent the texts, before making predictions for unseen data (new texts):', 'Ultimately, the more data these NLP algorithms are fed, the more accurate the text analysis models will be.', 'Sentiment analysis (seen in the above chart) is one of the most popular NLP tasks, where machine learning models are trained to classify text by polarity of opinion (positive, negative, neutral, and everywhere in between).', 'Try out sentiment analysis for yourself by typing text in the NLP model, below', 'Test with your own text', 'Results', 'The biggest advantage of machine learning models is their ability to learn on their own, with no need to define manual rules.', 'You just need a set of relevant training data with several examples for the tags you want to analyze.', 'And with advanced deep learning algorithms, you’re able to chain together multiple natural language processing tasks, like sentiment analysis, keyword extraction, topic classification, intent detection, and more, to work simultaneously for super fine-grained results.', 'Common NLP Tasks & Techniques', 'Many natural language processing tasks involve syntactic and semantic analysis, used to break down human language into machine-readable chunks.', 'Syntactic analysis, also known as parsing or syntax analysis, identifies the syntactic structure of a text and the dependency relationships between words, represented on a diagram called a parse tree.', 'Semantic analysis focuses on identifying the meaning of language.', 'However, since language is polysemic and ambiguous, semantics is considered one of the most challenging areas in NLP.', 'Semantic tasks analyze the structure of sentences, word interactions, and related concepts, in an attempt to discover the meaning of words, as well as understand the topic of a text.', 'Below, we’ve listed some of the main sub-tasks of both semantic and syntactic analysis:', 'Tokenization', 'Tokenization is an essential task in natural language processing used to break up a string of words into semantically useful units called tokens.', 'Sentence tokenization splits sentences within a text, and word tokenization splits words within a sentence.', 'Generally, word tokens are separated by blank spaces, and sentence tokens by stops.', 'However, you can perform high-level tokenization for more complex structures, like words that often go together, otherwise known as collocations (e.g., New York).', 'An example of how word tokenization simplifies text:', 'Here’s an example of how word tokenization simplifies text:', 'Customer service couldn’t be better!', '= “customer service” “could” “not” “be” “better”.', 'Part-of-speech tagging', 'Part-of-speech tagging (abbreviated as PoS tagging) involves adding a part of speech category to each token within a text.', 'Some common PoS tags are verb, adjective, noun, pronoun, conjunction, preposition, intersection, among others.', 'In this case, the example above would look like this:', '“Customer service”: NOUN, “could”: VERB, “not”: ADVERB, be”: VERB, “better”: ADJECTIVE, “!”: PUNCTUATION', 'PoS tagging is useful for identifying relationships between words and, therefore, understand the meaning of sentences.', 'Dependency Parsing', 'Dependency grammar refers to the way the words in a sentence are connected.', 'A dependency parser, therefore, analyzes how ‘head words’ are related and modified by other words too understand the syntactic structure of a sentence:', 'Constituency Parsing', 'Constituency Parsing aims to visualize the entire syntactic structure of a sentence by identifying phrase structure grammar.', 'It consists of using abstract terminal and non-terminal nodes associated to words, as shown in this example:', 'You can try different parsing algorithms and strategies depending on the nature of the text you intend to analyze, and the level of complexity you’d like to achieve.', 'Lemmatization & Stemming', 'When we speak or write, we tend to use inflected forms of a word (words in their different grammatical forms).', 'To make these words easier for computers to understand, NLP uses lemmatization and stemming to transform them back to their root form.', 'The word as it appears in the dictionary – its root form – is called a lemma.', 'For example, the terms \"is, are, am, were, and been,” are grouped under the lemma ‘be.’', 'So, if we apply this lemmatization to “African elephants have four nails on their front feet,” the result will look something like this:', 'African elephants have four nails on their front feet = “African,” “elephant,” “have,” “4”, “nail,” “on,” “their,” “foot”]', 'This example is useful to see how the lemmatization changes the sentence using its base form (e.g., the word \"feet\"\" was changed to \"foot\").', 'When we refer to stemming, the root form of a word is called a stem.', 'Stemming \"trims\" words, so word stems may not always be semantically correct.', 'For example, stemming the words “consult,” “consultant,” “consulting,” and “consultants” would result in the root form “consult.”', 'While lemmatization is dictionary-based and chooses the appropriate lemma based on context, stemming operates on single words without considering the context.', 'For example, in the sentence:', '“This is better”', 'The word “better” is transformed into the word “good” by a lemmatizer but is unchanged by stemming.', 'Even though stemmers can lead to less-accurate results, they are easier to build and perform faster than lemmatizers.', \"But lemmatizers are recommended if you're seeking more precise linguistic rules.\", 'Stopword Removal', 'Removing stop words is an essential step in NLP text processing.', 'It involves filtering out high-frequency words that add little or no semantic value to a sentence, for example, which, to, at, for, is, etc.', 'You can even customize lists of stopwords to include words that you want to ignore.', 'Let’s say you want to classify customer service tickets based on their topics.', 'In this example: “Hello, I’m having trouble logging in with my new password”, it may be useful to remove stop words like “hello”, “I”, “am”, “with”, “my”, so you’re left with the words that help you understand the topic of the ticket: “trouble”, “logging in”, “new”, “password”.', 'Word Sense Disambiguation', 'Depending on their context, words can have different meanings.', 'Take the word “book”, for example:', 'You should read this book; it’s a great novel!', 'You should book the flights as soon as possible.', 'You should close the books by the end of the year.', 'You should do everything by the book to avoid potential complications.', 'There are two main techniques that can be used for word sense disambiguation (WSD): knowledge-based (or dictionary approach) or supervised approach.', 'The first one tries to infer meaning by observing the dictionary definitions of ambiguous terms within a text, while the latter is based on natural language processing algorithms that learn from training data.', 'Named Entity Recognition (NER)', 'Named entity recognition is one of the most popular tasks in semantic analysis and involves extracting entities from within a text.', 'Entities can be  names, places, organizations, email addresses, and more.', 'Relationship extraction, another sub-task of NLP, goes one step further and finds relationships between two nouns.', 'For example, in the phrase “Susan lives in Los Angeles,” a person (Susan) is related to a place (Los Angeles) by the semantic category “lives in.”', 'Text Classification', 'Text classification is the process of understanding the meaning of unstructured text and organizing it into predefined categories (tags).', 'One of the most popular text classification tasks is sentiment analysis, which aims to categorize unstructured data by sentiment.', 'Other classification tasks include intent detection, topic modeling, and language detection.', 'Challenges of  Natural Language Processing', 'There are many challenges in Natural language processing but one of the main reasons NLP is difficult is simply because human language is ambiguous.', 'Even humans struggle to analyze and classify human language correctly.', 'Take sarcasm, for example.', 'How do you teach a machine to understand an expression that’s used to say the opposite of what’s true?', 'While humans would easily detect sarcasm in this comment, below, it would be challenging to teach a machine how to interpret this phrase:', '“If I had a dollar for every smart thing you say, I’d be poor.”', 'To fully comprehend human language, data scientists need to teach NLP tools to look beyond definitions and word order, to understand context, word ambiguities, and other complex concepts connected to messages.\\n', 'But, they also need to consider other aspects, like culture, background, and gender, when fine-tuning natural language processing models.', 'Sarcasm and humor, for example, can vary greatly from one country to the next.', 'Natural language processing and powerful machine learning algorithms (often multiple used in collaboration) are improving, and bringing order to the chaos of human language, right down to concepts like sarcasm.', 'We are also starting to see new trends in NLP, so we can expect NLP to revolutionize the way humans and technology collaborate in the near future and beyond.', 'Natural Language Processing Examples', 'Although natural language processing continues to evolve, there are already many ways in which it is being used today.', 'Most of the time you’ll be exposed to natural language processing without even realizing it.', 'Often, NLP is running in the background of the tools and applications we use everyday, helping businesses improve our experiences.', \"Below, we've highlighted some of the most common and most powerful uses of natural language processing in everyday life:\", '11 Common Examples of NLP', 'Email filters', 'Virtual assistants, voice assistants, or smart speakers', 'Online search engines', 'Predictive text and autocorrect', 'Monitor brand sentiment on social media', 'Sorting customer feedback', 'Automating processes in customer support', 'Chatbots', 'Automatic summarization', 'Machine translation', 'Natural language generation', 'Email filters', 'As mentioned above, email filters are one of the most common and most basic uses of NLP.', 'When they were first introduced, they weren’t entirely accurate, but with years of machine learning training on millions of data samples, emails rarely slip into the wrong inbox these days.', 'Virtual assistants, voice assistants, or smart speakers', 'The most common being Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s Alexa, virtual assistants use NLP machine learning technology to understand and automatically process voice requests.', 'Natural language processing algorithms allow the assistants to be custom-trained by individual users with no additional input, to learn from previous interactions, recall related queries, and connect to other apps.', 'The use of voice assistants is expected to continue to grow exponentially as they are used to control home security systems, thermostats, lights, and cars – even let you know what you’re running low on in the refrigerator.', 'Online search engines', 'Whenever you do a simple Google search, you’re using NLP machine learning.', 'They use highly trained algorithms that, not only search for related words, but for the intent of the searcher.', 'Results often change on a daily basis, following trending queries and morphing right along with human language.', 'They even learn to suggest topics and subjects related to your query that you may not have even realized you were interested in.', 'Predictive text', 'Every time you type a text on your smartphone, you see NLP in action.', 'You often only have to type a few letters of a word, and the texting app will suggest the correct one for you.', 'And the more you text, the more accurate it becomes, often recognizing commonly used words and names faster than you can type them.', 'Predictive text, autocorrect, and autocomplete have become so accurate in word processing programs, like MS Word and Google Docs, that they can make us feel like we need to go back to grammar school.', 'Monitor brand sentiment on social media', 'Sentiment analysis is the automated process of classifying opinions in a text as positive, negative, or neutral.', 'It’s often used to monitor sentiments on social media.', 'You can track and analyze sentiment in comments about your overall brand, a product, particular feature, or compare your brand to your competition.', 'Imagine you’ve just released a new product and want to detect your customers’ initial reactions.', 'Maybe a customer tweeted discontent about your customer service.', 'By tracking sentiment analysis, you can spot these negative comments right away and respond immediately.', 'Quickly sorting customer feedback', 'Text classification is a core NLP task that assigns predefined categories (tags) to a text, based on its content.  ', 'It’s great for organizing qualitative feedback (product reviews, social media conversations, surveys, etc.) into appropriate subjects or department categories.', 'Retently, a SaaS platform, used NLP tools to classify NPS responses and gain actionable insights in next to no time:', 'Retently discovered  the most relevant topics mentioned by customers, and which ones they valued most.', 'Below, you can see that most of the responses referred to “Product Features,” followed by “Product UX” and “Customer Support” (the last two topics were mentioned mostly by Promoters).', 'Automating processes in customer service', 'Other interesting applications of NLP revolve around customer service automation.', 'This concept uses AI-based technology to eliminate or reduce routine manual tasks in customer support, saving agents valuable time, and making processes more efficient.', 'According to the Zendesk benchmark, a tech company receives +2600 support inquiries per month.', 'Receiving large amounts of support tickets from different channels (email, social media, live chat, etc), means companies need to have a strategy in place to categorize each incoming ticket.', 'Text classification allows companies to automatically tag incoming customer support tickets according to their topic, language, sentiment, or urgency.', 'Then, based on these tags, they can instantly route tickets to the most appropriate pool of agents.', 'Uber designed its own ticket routing workflow, which involves tagging tickets by Country, Language, and Type (this category includes the sub-tags Driver-Partner, Questions about Payments, Lost Items, etc), and following some prioritization rules, like sending requests from new customers (New Driver-Partners) are sent to the top of the list.', 'Chatbots', 'A chatbot is a computer program that simulates human conversation.', 'Chatbots use NLP to recognize the intent behind a sentence, identify relevant topics and keywords, even emotions, and come up with the best response based on their interpretation of data.', 'As customers crave fast, personalized, and around-the-clock support experiences, chatbots have become the heroes of customer service strategies.', 'Chatbots reduce customer waiting times by providing immediate responses and especially excel at handling routine queries (which usually represent the highest volume of customer support requests), allowing agents to focus on solving more complex issues.', 'In fact, chatbots can solve up to 80% of routine customer support tickets.', 'Besides providing customer support, chatbots can be used to recommend products, offer discounts, and make reservations, among many other tasks.', 'In order to do that, most chatbots follow a simple ‘if/then’ logic (they are programmed to identify intents and associate them with a certain action), or provide a selection of options to choose from.', 'Automatic summarization', 'Automatic summarization consists of reducing a text and creating a concise new version that contains its most relevant information.', 'It can be particularly useful to summarize large pieces of unstructured data, such as academic papers.', 'There are two different ways to use NLP for summarization:', 'To extract the most important information within a text and use it to create a summary (extraction-based summarization)', 'Apply deep learning techniques to paraphrase the text and produce sentences that are not present in the original source (abstraction-based summarization).', 'Automatic summarization can be particularly useful for data entry, where relevant information is extracted from a product description, for example, and automatically entered into a database.', 'Machine translation', 'The possibility of translating text and speech to different languages has always been one of the main interests in the NLP field.', 'From the first attempts to translate text from Russian to English in the 1950s to state-of-the-art deep learning neural systems, machine translation (MT) has seen significant improvements but still presents challenges.', 'Google Translate, Microsoft Translator, and Facebook Translation App are a few of the leading platforms for generic machine translation.', 'In August 2019, Facebook AI English-to-German machine translation model received first place in the contest held by the Conference of Machine Learning (WMT).', 'The translations obtained by this model were defined by the organizers as “superhuman” and considered highly superior to the ones performed by human experts.', 'Another interesting development in machine translation has to do with customizable machine translation systems, which are adapted to a specific domain and trained to understand the terminology associated with a particular field, such as medicine, law, and finance.', 'Lingua Custodia, for example, is a machine translation tool dedicated to translating technical financial documents.', 'Finally, one of the latest innovations in MT is adaptative machine translation, which consists of systems that can learn from corrections in real-time.', 'Natural language generation', 'Natural Language Generation (NLG) is a subfield of NLP designed to build computer systems or applications that can automatically produce all kinds of texts in natural language by using a semantic representation as input.', 'Some of the applications of NLG are question answering and text summarization.', 'In 2019, artificial intelligence company Open AI released GPT-2, a text-generation system that represented a groundbreaking achievement in AI and has taken the NLG field to a whole new level.', 'The system was trained with a massive dataset of 8 million web pages and it’s able to generate coherent and high-quality pieces of text (like news articles, stories, or poems), given minimum prompts.', 'The model performs better when provided with popular topics which have a high representation in the data (such as Brexit, for example), while it offers poorer results when prompted with highly niched or technical content.', 'Still, it’s possibilities are only beginning to be explored.', 'Natural Language Processing with Python', 'Now that you’ve gained some insight into the basics of NLP and its current applications in business, you may be wondering how to put NLP into practice.', 'There are many open-source libraries designed to work with natural language processing.', 'These libraries are free, flexible, and allow you to build a complete and customized NLP solution.', 'However, building a whole infrastructure from scratch requires years of data science and programming experience or you may have to hire whole teams of engineers.', 'SaaS tools, on the other hand, are ready-to-use solutions that allow you to incorporate NLP into tools you already use simply and with very little setup.', 'Connecting SaaS tools to your favorite apps through their APIs is easy and only requires a few lines of code.', 'It’s an excellent alternative if you don’t want to invest time and resources learning about machine learning or NLP.', 'Take a look at the Build vs. Buy Debate to learn more.', 'Here’s a list of the top NLP tools:', 'MonkeyLearn is a SaaS platform that lets you build customized natural language processing models to perform tasks like sentiment analysis and keyword extraction.', 'Developers can connect NLP models via the API in Python, while those with no programming skills can upload datasets via the smart interface, or connect to everyday apps like Google Sheets, Excel, Zapier, Zendesk, and more.', 'Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) is a suite of libraries for building Python programs that can deal with a wide variety of NLP tasks.', 'It is the most popular Python library for NLP, has a very active community behind it, and is often used for educational purposes.', 'There is a handbook and tutorial for using NLTK, but it’s a pretty steep learning curve.', 'SpaCy is a free open-source library for advanced natural language processing in Python.', 'It has been specifically designed to build NLP applications that can help you understand large volumes of text.', 'TextBlob is a Python library with a simple interface to perform a variety of NLP tasks.', 'Built on the shoulders of NLTK and another library called Pattern, it is intuitive and user-friendly, which makes it ideal for beginners.', 'Learn more about how to use TextBlob and its features.', 'Natural Language Processing Tutorial', 'SaaS solutions like MonkeyLearn offer ready-to-use NLP templates for
